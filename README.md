# How Do I Code Search for Sublime Text 3

A plugin leveraging [howdoi - a unix code search tool](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) terminal command to be useable from sublime text.

Look for How Do I: code search in command palette entery query and the response is shown in a new tab or view when the query returns

# Install
Until this is availible on package control you'll have to either 
git clone: https://github.com/jlangston/SublimeHowDoI into your packages folder or

At this point you have to have [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) installed and working from the command line for this plugin to work at all

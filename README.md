# How Do I Code Search for Sublime Text 2

A plugin leveraging [howdoi - a unix code search tool](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) terminal command to be useable from sublime text.

Look for How Do I: code search in command palette entery query and the response is shown in a new tab or view when the query returns

Change Log
1. Rewrite much of the code base to make it compatible with ST3. Borrowed some codes from kemayo's sublime-text-2-goto-documentation at https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-goto-documentation.git 
2. Add support of howdoi options except --color since ST3 have better syntax highlight scheme.
3. Add status message for user notification
4. Add main menu of Preferences

# Install
Until this is availible on package control you'll have to either 
git clone: https://github.com/jlangston/SublimeHowDoI into your packages folder or
download the zip of the repository and place that in your packages folder

At this point you have to have [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) installed and working from the command line for this plugin to work at all


# Usage

# Disclaimer

This is my first go at a sublime text plugin it's only been tested on OSX and Windows and still has lots of room for improvement and polish.

# Other Notes

Ideally the entire utility could be packaged up into the plugin without having to require having the command line version installed but all the python library dependencies would need to be sorted out to be included with the plugin.

If you like the idea behind this plugin and would like to see improvements pull requests are welcome
